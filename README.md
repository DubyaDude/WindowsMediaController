# Windows Media Controller
This repository allows developers to more easily get information from and interact with the Windows 10/11 OS media interface.

This allows for a better understanding and control of the Media Sessions and can have many different applications. Some features include:
- Control playback on individual Media Sessions (Spotify, Chrome etc)
- Get media information of currently playing (Song, Author, Thumbnail etc)

## Requirements
- Windows 10 (Build 17763+) or Windows 11
- The ability to talk to Windows Runtime. (In a majority of cases, this will not be an issue)
- .NET Framework 4.6+ or .NET Core 3.0+
