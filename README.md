# WindowsMediaController
This is a simple wrapper for the Windows 10 Media Sessions Controller.

This allows for a better understanding and control of the Media Sessions and can have many different applications.
- Controlling on a per-media basis rather then depending on emulating media keyboard keys.
- Getting currently playing music title, author and even artwork.
- Knowing when a Media source open/closes.
